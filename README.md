# Gradient-Boosting-for-ML


Implement gradient boosting model using approximate function
f(x) =0.8cos(3.2πx) + 0.64cos(10.24πx) + 0.51cos(32.77πx), 
with samples between [0,2] interval in increments of 0.005 units (401 samples), to an accuracy (mean absolute error) as shown in the equation picture.
